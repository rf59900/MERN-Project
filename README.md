## Features

CurrentConversations seeks to give its users the ability to create meaningful conversations between users with features such as multiple topic boards (Currenly 5, but can support an infinite amount), posts that support images, comments that support images, and nested replies that also support images. Users can express themselves through an avatar image or have none at all, at any time users can change their avatar (By clicking their own profile image on their profile page). Users can view their own or others profiles where they can see all of their posts and comments as well as an about section. CurrentConversations is moderated by admin users who have the ability to delete posts (Which also deletes the post image and all comments and images associated with those comments), delete comments (Which also deletes the comment image and all replies with their images), as well as deleting users (Which deletes all of a users posts, comments, and associated images).
